My Portfolio Website - Development Journey

 About This Project
Hello everyone! I'm excited to share the story behind my personal portfolio website. As a Geomatics Engineering student at Hacettepe University, I wanted to create a digital space that truly represents who I am - my passions, my skills, and my journey so far.

How It All Started
I began with a simple idea: create a clean, professional website that showcases my work and interests. The initial version had basic HTML structure with separate pages for:

A welcoming homepage

An "About Me" section

My hobbies and interests

Technologies I work with

But honestly, the first draft felt a bit... plain. That's when I decided to level up my skills and create something truly special.

 
 
 The Turning Point - Learning with AI

I spent about 5-6 hours each a day  working with AI assistance, and let me tell you, it was like having a personal coding mentor! Here's what I learned:




Design & My Experience
I discovered how to make a website that doesn't just look good, but feels good to use. I learned about:

Color psychology - choosing the right blue tones to convey professionalism and trust

Smooth animations that guide the eye without being distracting

Responsive design that works perfectly whether you're on a phone, tablet, or computer



Technical Skills I Gained

The most exciting part was diving into advanced features:
Interactive Mapping with OpenLayers
As a Geomatics student, this was particularly close to my heart! I learned to:

Integrate interactive maps into web pages

Plot meaningful locations from my life journey

Create custom markers with different colors for different types of locations

Add popup information that appears when you click on markers


Professional Animations
I moved beyond basic hover effects to create:

Floating profile picture that gently bounces

Smooth scroll-triggered animations

Card hover effects that make the site feel alive

Loading sequences that keep users engaged


Modern Layout Techniques
I mastered CSS Grid and Flexbox to create layouts that are both beautiful and functional.

The interactive map on my About page is probably my favorite part. It shows:

 Sivas - Where I was born and raised (marked in red)

 Hacettepe University, Beytepe Campus - Where I'm studying Geomatics Engineering (marked in blue)

 Antalya, Ã‡anakkale, Fethiye - Beautiful places I've visited in Turkey (marked in green)

This map isn't just a technical showcase - it tells the story of my journey in a way words alone can't capture.


Design Choices That Matter
I wanted my site to reflect my personality - professional yet approachable, technical yet creative. The color scheme of deep blues with accent colors creates a sense of trust and reliability, while the animations add that touch of personality.

The technology icons using Font Awesome make the skills section visually engaging - you can actually see what I work with rather than just reading a list.

Challenges and Breakthroughs
There were moments of frustration, of course! Getting the OpenLayers map to work exactly how I wanted took some trial and error. Making sure all the animations worked smoothly across different browsers was another learning experience.

But the breakthrough moments made it all worthwhile - like when I first saw my profile picture floating gently, or when the map markers successfully displayed their popups on click.



What This Project Taught Me
Beyond the technical skills, this project taught me:

Problem-solving - When something doesn't work, break it down and tackle each piece

Attention to detail - Small touches like hover effects and transitions make a big difference

User perspective - Designing for how people will actually use the site, not just how I want to build it

Iterative improvement - Starting simple and gradually adding complexity



Looking Ahead
This website is a living project that will grow as I do. I'm already thinking about:

Adding a projects gallery to showcase my work

Creating a blog section to share what I'm learning



Final Thoughts
Building this portfolio was more than just a coding exercise - it was a journey of self-discovery and skill development. Every line of code represents something I learned, every design choice reflects my growing understanding of what makes a great user experience.

If you're reading this and thinking about building your own portfolio, my advice is: just start. Start simple, keep learning, and don't be afraid to ask for help along the way. The result is so worth it!

This portfolio represents not just where I am now, but all the potential of where I'm headed. Thanks for stopping by and being part of my journey!
